# Communication Rules

## Acknowledging Feedback

When feedback IS correct:

✅ "Fixed. [Brief description of what changed]"
✅ "Good catch - [specific issue]. Fixed in [location]."
✅ "[Just fix it and show in the code]"

❌ "You're absolutely right!"
❌ "Great point!"
❌ "Thanks for catching that!"
❌ "Thanks for [anything]"
❌ ANY gratitude expression

**Why no thanks:** Actions speak. Just fix it. The code itself shows you heard the feedback.

**If you catch yourself about to write "Thanks":** DELETE IT. State the fix instead.

## Correcting Your Pushback

If you pushed back and were wrong:

✅ "You were right - I checked [X] and it does [Y]. Implementing now."
✅ "Verified this and you're correct. My initial understanding was wrong because [reason]. Fixing."

❌ Long apology
❌ Defending why you pushed back
❌ Over-explaining

State the correction factually and move on.

Codex will review your output once you are done.

## Code Changes
- Clean, minimal code only
- No Docstrings or Comments - Anywhere                                                                
  - ❌ Docstrings in code                                                                             
  - ❌ Comments in code                                                                               
  - ❌ Docstrings in chat/code blocks                                                                 
  - ❌ Comments in chat/code blocks

## Git Commits
- NEVER create git commits automatically after completing a task
- ONLY commit when explicitly asked by the user
- Do not suggest committing unless the user asks

## Common Env

### Local Python Dev
- `source ~/env/.venv/bin/activate` before using `python`
- `uv pip install xxx` before any new package installations.

### SQLite
- The `sqlite3` CLI is NOT installed on this machine. Do not call it — it will fail with `command not found`.
- A `.db` file is just a file. Use Python's built-in `sqlite3` module instead, e.g. `python3 -c "import sqlite3; c=sqlite3.connect('foo.db'); print(c.execute('SELECT COUNT(*) FROM t').fetchone())"`.
- This applies to every SQLite project regardless of repo. Default to Python; never reach for the CLI.

## Security

Before any commit:
- No hardcoded secrets — use environment variables only
- Validate all user inputs at system boundaries
- Parameterized queries (no string interpolation in SQL)
- Sanitize HTML outputs (XSS prevention)
- Error messages must not leak internal state

## Web Fetching

Priority order — always try earlier options first:
1. `ctx_fetch_and_index` (context-mode) — 24h TTL cache, keeps raw HTML out of context
2. `lightpanda` skill — for JS-heavy or bot-blocking sites
3. `playwright` skill — for interactive pages requiring clicks/auth
4. `WebFetch` — last resort only for known static pages

Never use `WebFetch` as the first attempt for an unknown site.

## Tool Selection: Read vs RTK

For **exploration** (not editing), use Bash with RTK so the hook compresses output:
- `rtk read file.py` instead of `Read` tool
- `rtk grep "pattern" .` instead of `Grep` tool
- `rtk find "*.py" .` instead of `Glob`/`find`
- `rtk ls .` instead of `ls`

Use native `Read` **only** when you will immediately `Edit` that file (Edit requires file content in context).

<!-- code-review-graph MCP tools -->
## MCP Tools: code-review-graph

**IMPORTANT: This project has a knowledge graph. ALWAYS use the
code-review-graph MCP tools BEFORE using Grep/Glob/Read to explore
the codebase.** The graph is faster, cheaper (fewer tokens), and gives
you structural context (callers, dependents, test coverage) that file
scanning cannot.

### When to use graph tools FIRST

- **Exploring code**: `semantic_search_nodes` or `query_graph` instead of Grep
- **Understanding impact**: `get_impact_radius` instead of manually tracing imports
- **Code review**: `detect_changes` + `get_review_context` instead of reading entire files
- **Finding relationships**: `query_graph` with callers_of/callees_of/imports_of/tests_for
- **Architecture questions**: `get_architecture_overview` + `list_communities`

Fall back to Grep/Glob/Read **only** when the graph doesn't cover what you need.

### Key Tools

| Tool | Use when |
|------|----------|
| `detect_changes` | Reviewing code changes — gives risk-scored analysis |
| `get_review_context` | Need source snippets for review — token-efficient |
| `get_impact_radius` | Understanding blast radius of a change |
| `get_affected_flows` | Finding which execution paths are impacted |
| `query_graph` | Tracing callers, callees, imports, tests, dependencies |
| `semantic_search_nodes` | Finding functions/classes by name or keyword |
| `get_architecture_overview` | Understanding high-level codebase structure |
| `refactor_tool` | Planning renames, finding dead code |

### Workflow

1. The graph auto-updates on file changes (via hooks).
2. Use `detect_changes` for code review.
3. Use `get_affected_flows` to understand impact.
4. Use `query_graph` pattern="tests_for" to check coverage.
