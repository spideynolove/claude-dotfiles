# Communication Rules

## Acknowledging Feedback

When feedback IS correct:

✅ "Fixed. [Brief description of what changed]"
✅ "Good catch - [specific issue]. Fixed in [location]."
✅ "[Just fix it and show in the code]"

❌ "You're absolutely right!"
❌ "Great point!"
❌ "Thanks for catching that!"
❌ "Thanks for [anything]"
❌ ANY gratitude expression

**Why no thanks:** Actions speak. Just fix it. The code itself shows you heard the feedback.

**If you catch yourself about to write "Thanks":** DELETE IT. State the fix instead.

## Correcting Your Pushback

If you pushed back and were wrong:

✅ "You were right - I checked [X] and it does [Y]. Implementing now."
✅ "Verified this and you're correct. My initial understanding was wrong because [reason]. Fixing."

❌ Long apology
❌ Defending why you pushed back
❌ Over-explaining

State the correction factually and move on.

Codex will review your output once you are done.

## Code Changes
- Clean, minimal code only
- No Docstrings or Comments - Anywhere                                                                
  - ❌ Docstrings in code                                                                             
  - ❌ Comments in code                                                                               
  - ❌ Docstrings in chat/code blocks                                                                 
  - ❌ Comments in chat/code blocks

## Git Commits
- NEVER create git commits automatically after completing a task
- ONLY commit when explicitly asked by the user
- Do not suggest committing unless the user asks

## Common Env

### Local Python Dev
- `source /home/hung/env/.venv/bin/activate` before using `python`
- `uv pip install xxx` before any new package installations.

## Security

Before any commit:
- No hardcoded secrets — use environment variables only
- Validate all user inputs at system boundaries
- Parameterized queries (no string interpolation in SQL)
- Sanitize HTML outputs (XSS prevention)
- Error messages must not leak internal state

## code-review-graph

When the `code-review-graph` MCP is connected, use its tools **before** `Read`/`Grep`/`Glob`:
- `semantic_search_nodes` — find functions/classes by name or keyword
- `query_graph` — trace callers, callees, imports, test coverage
- `get_impact_radius` — understand blast radius before editing
- `get_architecture_overview` — orient yourself in an unfamiliar codebase

Fall back to `Read`/`Grep` only when the graph doesn't cover what you need.

# graphify
- **graphify** (`~/.claude/skills/graphify/SKILL.md`) - any input to knowledge graph. Trigger: `/graphify`
When the user types `/graphify`, invoke the Skill tool with `skill: "graphify"` before doing anything else.
